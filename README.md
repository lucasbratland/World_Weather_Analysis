# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview of the World Weather Analysis
We work for the PlanMyTrip app. We are tasked with adding the weather description to the weather data. Also, we are to take input from the users in regards to their preferre3d temperature range for their trip. From these results, the client will choose 4 cities that they want to travel to, and we will design their travel route between the four cities.
