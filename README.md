# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview of the World Weather Analysis
We work for the PlanMyTrip app. We are tasked with adding the weather description to the weather data. Also, we are to take input from the users in regards to their preferre3d temperature range for their trip. From these results, the client will choose 4 cities that they want to travel to, and we will design their travel route between the four cities. 

## Resources
Software: jupyter Notebook
APIs: Google, Openweather

## Results
### There were three deliverables for this module. 
- Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data located in the [Weather_Database folder](Weather_Database/)
    - This includes a csv of all the random locations for the client to choose from for their vacation.
    - This also includes the Jupyter Notebook file that has all the code.

- Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map located in the [Vacation_Search folder](Vacation_Search/)
    - This includes a csv of all the cities chosen because their max temp was between 75 and 90 degrees. 
    - This also includes a visual of all the locations.
    - The Jupyter Notebook of the code is also included.

- Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map located in the [Vacation_Itinerary folder](Vacation_Itinerary/)
    - This includes 2 visuals. One that shows the intended [driving route.](Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map.png) The other is shows a recommeded hotel in each [stop.](Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png)
    - The Jupyter Notebook of code is also included.
